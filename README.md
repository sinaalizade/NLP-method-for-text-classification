# NLP-method-for-text-classification
Using the NLP method for preparing data (text and string sequences) and classification
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human language, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. The goal is a computer capable of "understanding" the contents of documents, including the contextual nuances of the language within them. The technology can then accurately extract information and insights contained in the documents as well as categorize and organize the documents themselves.
Challenges in natural language processing frequently involve speech recognition, natural language understanding, and natural language generation.
I implemented and test the code in Persian, Chines, and Turkish languages from preprocessing and data cleaning to text classification.

Requirement Libraries:

NLTK: 

NLTK is a leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data. It provides easy-to-use interfaces to over 50 corpora and lexical resources such as WordNet, along with a suite of text processing libraries for classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning, wrappers for industrial-strength NLP libraries, and an active discussion forum.

NumPy (recommended):

This is a scientific computing library with support for multidimensional arrays and linear algebra, required for certain probability, tagging, clustering, and classification tasks.

Matplotlib (recommended):

This is a 2D plotting library for data visualization and is used in some parts of my project to produce line graphs and bar charts.
