# NLP-method-for-text-classification
Using the NLP method for preparing data (text and string sequences) and classification
Let start with the definitions:
Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human language, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. The goal is a computer capable of "understanding" the contents of documents, including the contextual nuances of the language within them. The technology can then accurately extract information and insights contained in the documents as well as categorize and organize the documents themselves.
Challenges in natural language processing frequently involve speech recognition, natural language understanding, and natural language generation.
This project is based on the book "Natural Language Processing with Python" and I implemented the code in Persian, Chines, and Turkish languages from preprocessing and data cleaning to text classification.
